run/latest — Runnable branch

This branch (`run/latest`) is a stable, runnable signpost created from `chore/cleanup-baselines`.

Purpose:
- Use this branch to run the test suite and demos (e.g., `pytest -q`, `python modules/fusion_616_engine.py`).
- Keep this branch small and stable; avoid adding archival or maintenance-only commits here.

Notes:
- If you need the pre-cleanup snapshot, use the `backup/pre-cleanup-2025-12-20` branch.
- This file is informational only and can be updated by maintainers to reflect policy or usage.
