# Archive (TruVision legacy)

This `archive/TruVision_files/` directory contains legacy forensic and analysis artifacts extracted from the original TrueVision integration. Files moved here are:

- **Read-only historical artifacts**: Forensic scripts, exploratory analyses, and one-off migration tools that are useful for historical investigation but not part of the active codebase.
- **Rationale**: Keeping these in an `archive/` directory preserves provenance and avoids cluttering the main project surface.

Reference: `docs/cleanup/orphan_mapping_v1.json`

Note: Archived files remain in Git history and are intended for read-only review. If a file becomes relevant again, it can be restored or selectively reintegrated.
