"""
Chain Reaction Smoke Test Suite

Philosophy:
    Test each module IN ISOLATION, then IN CHAIN.
    Each module's output MUST match next module's expected input.
    Any break in the chain = SYSTEM FAILURE.

Structure:
    Phase 1: Module isolation tests
    Phase 2: Chain reaction tests
    Phase 3: Full system smoke test
